# Introduction

Electron tomography is a technique for resolving the interior of nanomaterials from a series of projection images. __Discrete tomography__ approaches have been shown to reconstruct nanocrystals of increasing complexity. A key limitation of these methods is that they assume atoms to lie on a coarse spatial grid whereas, in practice, __lattice defects__ in nanocrystals cause atoms to deviate from regular positions.

We present two alternative __grid-free__ reconstruction methods:  

1. a __super-resolution__ approach that allows for continuous deviations of atom locations 
2. a __deep learning__ approach to identify atom locations from blurred reconstructions

# Summary of Main Results

1. Allowing for continuous deviations of atom locations __aids reconstruction__ of test lattices with data from __very few tilt angles__ (2 or 3).

2. Incorporating a physical model for the __potential energy of the atomic configuration__ corrects for __poor initialisations__.

3. __Learned post processing__ from reconstructed images performs poorly for limited data.

# Mathematical Formulation

An atomic configuration is characterised by a positive measure $\mu$ on a bounded subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which represents the electron density. The Radon transform of the measure, $\mathcal{R} \mu$, provides a simplified mathematical model of the image formation process. The corresponding inverse problem is to recover $\mu$ from noisy observations given by $y = \mathcal{R} \mu + \varepsilon$.

We consider atomic configurations to be __sparse measures__ of the form: $\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (G \ast \delta_{\boldsymbol{x}_i})$, where $G$ denotes a Gaussian that quantifies thermal motion of atoms and the weights $w_i$ are used to differentiate between atom types. 

To recover $\mu$, we model interatomic interactions explicitly by the __Lennard-Jones__ pair potential and solve the following optimisation problem:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \underset{\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathcal{C}, w \in \{0,1\}^n}{\text{minimise}}
    & & \Big \| \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \psi(\boldsymbol{x}_i) - y \Big \|^2_2 + \alpha V_{\text{tot}}(\vec{x}), \\
    \end{aligned}
$$
where $V_{\text{tot}}$ is the total potential energy and $\alpha$ is a regularisation parameter.

# Results

<img align="right" src="figures/animation.gif" width="600">


We used a modified version of the __alternating descent conditional gradient (ADCG)__ algorithm to obtain atom locations. At each iteration, the algorithm   
1. __adds a new atom__ on a coarse grid, and 
2. __locally moves__ all atoms.   

An animated reconstruction run is shown on the right.


### Comparison of reconstructions
<img align="center" src="figures/recos1_smaller.png" width="1200">

<small>Reconstructions of common lattice defects from 2 projections.  For simulated annealing, ADCG ($\alpha=0$) and ADCG with energy ($\alpha>0$) reconstructions, atoms are coloured according to their Euclidean distance from the ground truth. The ground truth positions  are  marked  with  red  crosses.</small>

### Effect of adding energy
<img src="figures/energy.png" width="1400">

<small>Tuning $\alpha$ amounts to moving from data-optimal to energy-optimal configurations. From the plots of potential energy and data discrepancy, an optimal value of $\alpha$ (indicated by the grey line) is selected. Increasing $\alpha$ beyond this optimal value leads to a large increase in the data discrepancy due to addition of more atoms.</small>

# Outlook

* Incorporate appropriate features of global optimisation into ADCG

* Use more realistic potential energy models

* Explore deep learning based iterative schemes to scale up to real electron tomography data
